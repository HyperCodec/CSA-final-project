# CSA Final Project
For my final project, I did a platform game. I kind of spent too much time making the engine because I didn't
have much of a project idea, and thus didn't have much time to make the end result as polished as I wanted.
I never used any AI or outside sources (aside from the crappy Jetbrains autocomplete and for some features that got removed/don't work properly anyway), relying more on my
own memory of past experiences with engines like Bevy and Unity to guide myself in making the engine.
However, depsite all that, it's still much more complex than the other submissions.

### Controls
- WASD - move (S in the air to fastfall/go through platfroms, hold W to jump higher)
- Q - dash
- F - bow
- click - melee

All attacks happen in the direction of the mouse.

### Known Bugs (didn't have time to fix)
- keybinds sometimes randomly don't register
- random lag spikes (likely caused by GC or something)
- some jank interactions with velocity
- built jar doesn't work (resource loading issues)
