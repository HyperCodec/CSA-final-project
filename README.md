# CSA Final Project
For my final project, I did a platform game. I kind of spent too much time making the engine because I didn't
have much of a project idea, and thus didn't have much time to make the end result as polished as I wanted.
However, it's still much more complex than the other submissions.

### Controls
- WASD - move (S in the air to fastfall/go through platfroms, hold W to jump higher)
- Q - dash
- F - bow
- click - melee

All attacks happen in the direction of the mouse.

### Known Bugs (didn't have time to fix)
- keybinds sometimes randomly don't register
- random lag spikes (likely caused by GC or something)
- some jank interactions with velocity
